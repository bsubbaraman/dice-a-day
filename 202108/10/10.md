Printing dots yesterday reminded me of circle packing that's popular with p5.js (e.g. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XATr_jdh-44)). First I wanted to see what range of sizes of dots I could get by extruding more or less filament:

This shows extruded blobs ranging from 1 to 9 mm of filament being extruded. Dots from >=3 seem reasonable to actually work with. Next: circles made of different sized blobs! After reminding myself of the law of cosines, I found value to increment my angle by:

I used this to test out one circle composed of dots:

In moving to concentric circles of different dot sizes, one problem is that there are necessarily an integer number of dots to complete the circle. this can be seen in the test circle above where the final dot it botched because it printed into an existing one. I'll leave fixing that for another day- for now, I just went ahead and printed concentric circles. I need to play with the spacing more; it gets messy right now because dots are printed into one another.

The bottom actually looks a *bit* cleaner:

I think if I play with this more it could make for a nice coaster :)
