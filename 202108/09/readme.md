Using the 'dot' technique from the line vase, I want to build a structure by only placing dots rather than uniformly extruding filament. I had stacked these vertically before, but now I need to figure out horizontal spacing. Measuring a few dots with calipers, they seem to be ~3mm wide on average (with my current filament/temp settings/extrusion amount/etc). Jumping straight into a 2D array of dots:

The dots were adhering to one another to make a sheet, and I thought the texture and look were satisfying. So, I went ahead and tried a dot-cube. At first I tried a small one:

And since that seemed to work well, I jumped straight to a bigger (20x20mm) cube:

The funal cube has a cool look & texture- it is also has a surprisingly nice bit of weight too it. Making this cube reminded me of adding pixelated filters on image- might be fun to experiment with 'dot-ifying' other models, as if using a different brush. In any case, more dots seems like a fun route to explore!
